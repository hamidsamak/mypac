# MyPac
MyPac is a dynamic proxy auto-config (PAC) manager for assigning single or multiple proxies for specific websites. If you are in a network with some blocked websites, you can use this to pass limits for blocked domains.

### Requirements
1. Web server
2. PHP

### Installation
1. Upload the package.
2. Add proxy server to `servers.txt`.
3. Add blocked domain to `domains.txt`. (Use `*` in the subdomain for all subdomains of the domain, e.g. \*.example.com).

### DISCLAIMER
Please use safe proxies, if you're not sure about server safety only use that for SSL enabled domains (HTTPS).
